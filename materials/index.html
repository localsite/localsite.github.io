       "Green Infrastructure (GI) has the potential to sequester atmospheric carbon, remove atmospheric pollutants, and reduce the urban heat island effect to save energy and money in cooling costs (Odefey et al., 2012). GI can restore natural hydrology, recharge groundwater, eliminate CSO contributions, and slow the flow of stormwater to streams to restore stream health (Dietz, 2007; Davis, 2008; Stephens et al., 2012)."

       The triple bottom line perspective combines financial, social and environmental benefits.

Origins of the movement: In Prince George County, Maryland (1999), "a large residential development called Sommerset used rain gardens on each property to control runoff levels as an alternative to constructing stormwater ponds and traditional stormwater conveyance."<br><br>

<h2>Productive Urban Forests</h2>

How to establish a mature, native forest in ten years to provide summer shade on the south side of Buildings — in ten times the normal rate of forests planted by humans.  After amending the soil to a depth of one meter, add a locally abundant biomass, then plant three to five saplings per square meter. "This grows into a forest so dense that after eight months, sunlight can’t reach the ground. At this point, every drop of rain that falls is conserved, and every leaf that falls is converted into humus. The more the forest grows, the more it generates nutrients for itself, accelerating further growth. This density also means that individual trees begin competing for sunlight — another reason these forests grow so fast." - <a href="https://fellowsblog.ted.com/how-to-grow-a-forest-really-really-fast-d27df202ba09">Source</a><br><br>


<h2>AI and IoT Monitoring</h2>  

Green Infrastructures benefit from monitoring using IoT sensors and community involovement coordinated by automated systems.<br><br>

"GI may have difficulty filtering certain pollutants, potentially leading to groundwater contamination by salts, pathogens, nitrate-nitrogen, and/or phosphorous (Dietz and Clausen, 2005, 2006; Dietz, 2007; Weiss et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2009). GI requires careful planning, implementation, and maintenance to be effective (Brown and Hunt, 2012), and sometimes legal barriers to implementation can be problematic (Morzaria-Luna et al., 2004)."<br><br>

"With rain gardens, soil media longevity is a concern. Once the infiltration media is clogged by filtered solids, the media will need to be either replaced or amended. Estimates of media longevity can vary considerably. Morgan et al. (2010) estimated the ability of a typical rain garden to adsorb zinc, copper, and cadmium would not be exhausted for centuries and is easy to rejuvenate. Jenkins et al. (2010) found that sediment accumulation had no significant impact on soil infiltration, at least in the first decade. Komlos and Traver (2012) suggest that soil may eventually become saturated with phosphorous after >20 years, which may limit effective life span or increase maintenance costs depending on the goal of the rain gar- den and risk to local groundwater. It is also possible that a rain garden will last significantly longer than its projected 35-year life (possibly indefinitely), but a lack of data prevents us from modeling this scenario."<br><br>

"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized (ISO, 2006) framework for analyzing the potential environmental performance of a product or service"   For details, see "Life Cycle Assessment: Principles and Practice" (Scientific Applications International Corporation and Curran, 2006).  Life cycle costing (LCC) (Swarr et al., 2011) steps are similar to LCA, "but do not include an impact assessment phase."<br><br>

<h2>Life Cycle Impact Categories</h2> 

"The life cycle impact categories include acidification, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, global warming gases, ozone depleting chemicals, photochemical oxidation, carcinogenics, noncarcinogenics, and respiratory effects."<br><br>
