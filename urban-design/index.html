<h1>Four perennial urban design themes</h1>
<pre>
<!-- Each theme will be
the focus for two weeks with lectures and assigned “classic” texts and class discussions. 
-->
How do the different authors propose that territory should be organized? 
How do they treat public space vs private property? 

Program vs type? 

Site vs cultural context? 

Social vs formal concerns? 

In addition to the “classic” texts, other brief readings will support the primary text, criticize it, or bring it into the present. The four themes are:

A City is Not a Tree (an abstract ordering system) - Christopher Alexander - 1966
Whereas a Semilattice - "semi" a grid with more complexity, variety.
Overlapping relationships.

Christopher Alexander
A Pattern Language - Vernacular Design - Christopher Alexander - Berkeley
Designing as sequence, self-generating systems. Father of wiki systems.
"Vernacular design is architecture based on local needs, local materials, and local traditions."
Said to Andres Duany "You are the plug" for my ideas.

Jan Gehl (pronounce Gail) “Close Encounters with Buildings” (in 1960's, 2006)
People will turn their head every 25 feet.
25 feet is the lenght of a New York storefront
200 feet is width of public space - because you can see facial expressions
The expert at converting main streets to pedestrian only - First in Copenhagen.
"People first placemaking" a place to pause, or sit.  
A space for people to peoplewatch.

Anthony Fontenot  “Notes Toward a History of Non-Planning” (2015)
Opposed to cold war 5-year planning. Totalitarian.
Sprawl is more representative of what people want.
Counter-argument: 80% of America is regulated to produce sprawl
Fontenot: But we need "a third way" like in N Columbia. 
A balance. Skyrail, libraries for slums.

Rem Koolhaas grew up in the Netherlands, one of the most planned countries.
Romanticized driving through junky highways as liberation. 
Americans romanticize the walkable European.

Video of lecture by Georgeen Theodore, Interboro 
- Focuses on "The next use of the space"
Their work would have an extended life - chairs get reused by local community
Detroit - shrinking cities - use of vacent lots.
Arsenal of Inclusion and Exclusion

The Charter of Athens - 1933
The Congress of the New Urbanism - Decided to write a new charter (but they are suburban)
= 6 architects who were trained by architects operating under the Charter of Athens 
East Coast New Urbanists - Sought to design to be more social and more beautiful.
West Coast - Regional, Vernacular, Affordable housing - Court yards and gardens, Environmentalist
91 - First meeting by invitation
93 - Open
94 or 95 - charter written. Sustainability was not mentioned.
The charter is 27 principles. Starts with the region. (No one has authority at the scale of the region.)
Neighborhood, District and Corridor
Avoids including "style" of individual buildings. "The sheeps clothing on the wolf of urbanism"
But they used sentimental, nostelgic style to get mixed use and density in a hostile market.
Today we are finalally lving up to the charter's non-style basis

Free market is equated with incremental.

Jane Jacobs collects data.

Context and Composition

Camillo Sitte - Buildings as walls for public outdoor spaces.  
Book was not published in English until 1940s.

Two distict center for two powers: The Church and the Temporal (the Signoria - royal residence) with 
a high terrace for public statements.  Signoria of Florence.
Market square with City Hall

Colin Rowe - Modern architecture has tended to produce objects rather than spaces.  Corners (outer angles, aggresive and protuberant) rather than inner angles (possibly passive and recessive). - From "The Present Urban Predicament"

For Colin Rowe you had to understand history (a good formalist is having a conversation) - lashed out at his own students (Michael Grave). Trained in England, went to Austin. Founded Urban Design program at Cornell. British.  Contextualism movement with postmodernism for better cities and better streets. Fascinated by the courthouse, stands for justice and democracy.  Embodied collage. Collage City book said Modernism had become a failed experiment, a Uopi nobody wanted to live in.

Compares Corbusian villas to Palladian Villas (different centuries, both using proportioning systems). Corbusier used proportions in elevations. Fixed slabs, even with columns. Cubist. Formalist.  Palladia has verticle freedo without slabs, depend on walls.

Figure-Ground - Black and White drawing technique popularized by Colin Rowe. Built objects are black. To look at solids and void. 
Gestalt Psychology says you will always perceived the simplest geopmetry first. Then complexity. Faces in vace.
The importance of the deformed type.

pochés = groups of structures that help to define the voids (public spaces and gardens).

<h2>70's and 80's - Reject of some aspects of modernism</h2>

More interested in form than people. Le Corbusier designed United Nations building in New York.

"Towers in the Park" - Gets rid of streetscapes. Closed off.

Modernism - zeitgist - spirit of the time (also Avante Guard) - where is culture going - designing for tomorrow

<p><b>Aldo Rossi</b> - the father of Neorationalism which embraces the past yet with different function.</p>
<!-- Read "A Scientific Antobiography" 1981 
The search for the collective memory. Analogous thought, verses logical thought-->
<p>"a general characteristic of urban artifacts that they return us to certain major themes: individuality, locus (location), design, memory." Note that functionality is absent.</p>

Parcel lines and streets are the most enduring elements.

The Dwelling area - the private relm
The Monuments
Urban artifacts - a sacred piece that won't be changed

Building types continue to the past - vernacular responses to climate, etc.
Morphology refers to urban patterns - streets, blocks, plots

Typo-morphology - study of interface between

<b>Leon Krier</b> - Also a Neorationalist. 
Architect who refused to build because current matterials used were crap.
Focused on reconstruction of pre-industrial European city.
Limited size, like a kingdom. Mixed-use. First to make a case on environmental grounds.
"It's not a type unless you can name it." Poundbury in England.
Master of black and white pen and ink.
Krier walk at Seaside.
More interested in urbanism than Rossi. (Morphology)


The Primative Hut - by Marc-Antoine Laugier in 1753 - Appears in Rossi collages
Perhaps the first scientific and philosophical theory of architecture.
"A young woman who personifies architecture draws the attention of an angelic child towards the primitive hut." She sits on the ruins of the past.  

<b>Brenda Case Scheer</b>
Urban tissue is the arrangment of lots, blocks and streets.
Static Tissues - single-family home developments
Campus Tissue - large single owner, including shopping malls. Can be changed suddenly.

<b>Bill Hillier</b> is the opposite of poetic-ness of Rossi
Computtional and network focused
Space Syntax - most connected, how far can you walk a mile. Red on maps. 
Also applies to buildings - networks of public and private access.
Arguing for the importance of networks. (transportation, social, economic)

Shape Grammer - Can we tell computers to generate new based on existing shape grammers.
Thanos Economou has come out with new software

The Single House (Charleston) - porch on south side

GA Tech Portman invented "Atrium Building" - Marriott marquis


<b>Rem Koolhaas</b>
Look for contradictions
who are the heros and enemies
Skyscrapers are a disconnect between the inside and outside, which allows freedom - vibrant and exciting.
Culture of conjestion. (Hugh Ferriss rendering make density dreamy - the womb of Manhatinism) 

Essay on Atlanta - Buildings don't talk to eachother. Architects hide building plans from adjacent developers.

Robert Venturi House for his mother

Michael Grave - Atlanta, part traditional, Formalism (the High Museum, form), studied under Colin Rowe.  



<!--
I'm a landscape urbanist enamored with cities designed around big parks.
Landscape is a context which contains architecture and civil engineering.
“unless there is tremendous density, human beings will not walk.” -  Andres Duany
Emo urbanism differs by making evolving "nature" a key component of the design process. 

Critism: 
"Larding the case for Landscape Urbanim with Deleuzian and Derridean (deconstruction = "the role of writing in the production of knowledge") references was a mistake, since it was done principally to impress an academic elite, and it has even left large sections of its intended audience bemused'." - Ian Thompson

How to fix the movement away from good urbanism in Atlanta's traditional neighborhood of Grant Park

During the 20th century, Grant Park was a model of traditional neighborhood design done well - a grid of connectivity, greenspace and conneccted alley pathways.

Since the turn of the century, Grant Park has become increasingly car dependent due to policies and regulations that prioritize driving. The neighborhood has witnessed the loss of affordable corner stores, afterhour recreation space at schools, neighborhood school locations that don't require driving

Most of the neighborhood's schools are surrounded by fences, opportunities to connect paths seperate from traffic have been non

The goal of this document is not to be a critique, but rather a proposal of radical new principles for repairing neighborhoods with the goal of expanding access to local recration, streamlinging delivery and design, and generating more clean water and energy than consumed.
